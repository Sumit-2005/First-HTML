    <h1> Sumit Bhagat's Projects</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the webpage dedicated to <b><i>My Projects</i></b>
        <br>
        As of now, I have made a couple of Data Analysis Projects in Python programming language 
        <br>
        My first project was a school project where I made a Data Analysis Project on NBA Payers and their stats
        <br>
        My second project has been an IPL Match Data Analysis project on matches from the 2008 season all the way to the 2019 season
        <br>
